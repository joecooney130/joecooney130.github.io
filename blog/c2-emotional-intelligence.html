      <h3>What learnings did you take from this chapter?</h3>
        
        <p>I found it interesting that mindfulness is a skill that can be easily learnt and applied to anyone's working life. I didn't realise that emotional intelligence had such a big part to play in any workplace and that is was such a sought after skill to have.</p>

      <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
        
        <p>I found my two minutes of mindfulness extremely relaxing. I tried the 'Easy' approach and while I often felt my mind wander to other things it was easy enough to bring it back to thinking about my breathing and stay in that mindful state. It is definitely something I want to continue to practice.</p>
