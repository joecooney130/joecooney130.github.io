          <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
            <p>Grid based design is a way to arrange a website's content into an easy to view and navigate grid. The layout takes advantage of the minds natural instincts when viewing a webpage by ranking the more interesting eye catching aspects of a page (e.g. images and headlines) over that of the other content (e.g. news stories).</p>
          <h3>What's all the hype about responsive web pages?</h3>
            <p>Responsive web pages allow people to view a page on many different devices. The page isn't fixed to a single size meaning that the page will still look good and be responsive weather you're looking at it on a phone screen or a desktop. It will change size and in some instances the content that is avaliable depending on the device you are accessing the site on.</p>
          <h3>Semantic Structure.</h3>
            <p>It is my understanding that semantics in reference to HTML helps to reinforce the meaning of the content of a webpage. Using tags like form, table, and img that describe the function rather than vague tags like div and span which are non-semantic.</p>
