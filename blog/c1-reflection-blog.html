        <h3>What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience?</h3>

          <p>EDA appears to be something completely different in my educational experience. The fully emmersive learning methods are innovative and it seems like a great way to learn something as complex and varied as wed development. </p>

        <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>

          <p>My impression is that their learning style may not suit everyone and I hope that I can adapt quickly as the course progresses. But it seems that the resources avaliable to students should give us every chance to succeed if we work hard enough and apply ourselves.</p>

        <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>

          <p>I will try to adapt my thinking and learning style so that I can get the most out of the course. I need to let go of my fear of being ignorant and not allow myself to get stuck because I'm too stubbord to ask for help.</p>

        <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>

          <p>My expectations have changed since starting sprint 1. The reality of the whole adventure has arrived and now I realise I will have to be much more organised and focused than I previously thought. I need to keep a positive attitude and an open mind throughout the process.</p>

        <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>

          <p>I am very excited and quite terrified at the same time! My biggest challenge will be reaching out to people for help, but I am excited to put the hard yards in and (hopefully) get the results I'm after.</p>
