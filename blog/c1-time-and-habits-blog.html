          <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
          
            <p>I looked into the "Pomodoro Technique" and also read about meditation and growth vs. fixed mindsets. </p>

          <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>

            <p>I found the pomodoro technique interesting, this could be a good way for me to schedule breaks rather than just taking random ones. I often find myself getting frustrated with something if I dont take more regular breaks so this could be a good strategy to impliment. Also the fixed vs growth mindset blog was facinating, I think I was able to develop into a growth mindset during my unversity studies through developing good work habits.</p>

          <h3>What worked for you?</h3>

            <p>I think the meditation technique would suit me best, I need to unwind completely and clear my mind otherwise during breaks I would keep thinking about the work I just completed or have yet to attempt.</p>

          <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>

            <p>I think I will try to implement the Pomodoro technique and see how I go with more regular breaks but I feel like meditation will be most beneficial to my learning style.</p>
